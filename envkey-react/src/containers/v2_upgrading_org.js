        <p>Once the upgrade finishes, <strong>come back here</strong> to upgrade your user account to v2 with a couple clicks.</p>

        <p><strong>One caveat:</strong> if your org switches to SSO, you'll get a separate invite to join EnvKey via your org's SSO system rather than upgrading from here. If that's the case, no further action is needed.</p>
