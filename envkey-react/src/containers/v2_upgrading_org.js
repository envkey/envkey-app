        <p><em>This organization is being upgraded to EnvKey v2.</em></p>

        <p>During the upgrade, your org will be in read-only mode. ENVKEYs will continue to work, but environment updates and other actions aren't allowed.</p>

        <p>Once the upgrade finishes, you can upgrade your user account to v2 with a couple clicks from within this, the v1 app.</p>

        <p>One caveat: if your org switches to SSO, you'll get a separate invite to join EnvKey via your org's SSO system rather than upgrading from here.</p>
