# EnvKey App

This is [EnvKey](https://www.envkey.com)'s cross-platform native application. It supports Mac, Windows, and Linux. 

EnvKey is an end-to-end encrypted secrets and configuration management tool. It keeps your configuration securely and automatically in sync for all your developers and servers.

The EnvKey App enforces a zero-knowledge protocol. The server never sees configuration in plain text, and never sees encryption passphrases.

# v2

Now that [EnvKey v2](https://v2.envkey.com) has been released, this repo is in maintenance mode. EnvKey v2 brings together all its public code in [a single monorepo](https://github.com/envkey/envkey).
